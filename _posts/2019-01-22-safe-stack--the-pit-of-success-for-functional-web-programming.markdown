## SAFE Stack: The Pit of Success for Functional Web Programming
<p>The SAFE stack is an free, open-source, flexible end-to-end, functional-first stack for cloud-ready web applications that emphasizes type-safe programming. It allows you to develop web applications almost entirely in F#, without needing to compromise and shoehorn your codebase into an object-oriented framework or library, and without needing you to be an expert in CSS or HTML to create compelling, rich client-side web applications.</p> <p>This talk will demonstrate the value proposition behind the SAFE Stack, illustrating how we can develop unified client / server applications that take the best features of F# and apply them throughout the stack - such as type safety, succinctness, productivity and performance - whilst still integrating naturally with technologies and frameworks such as ASP .NET, JavaScript and React.</p> <p>You'll see how to create data driven server-side APIs quickly and easily, and then surface those APIs in a rich, responsive web application running in the browser, using a combination of .NET and JavaScript libraries and tools that come together beautifully. Lastly, we'll see how easily SAFE apps can be hosted on a cloud platform such as Microsoft Azure.</p> <p>Isaac Abraham is an.

He specializes in consultancy, training and development, helping customers adopt high-quality, functional-first solutions on the .NET platform.</p>
