<p>Das nächste Treffen unserer Usergroup am 17.10.2013 statt. Wir treffen uns bei der <a href="http://www.t-systems-mms.com/">T-Systems MMS</a> und der Vortrag wird diesmal vom Erfinder von <a href="http://www.postsharp.net">Postsharp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gfraiteur">Gael Fraiteur</a> zum Thema “Design Pattern Automation” gehalten.     <br />Trag euch wie immer bitte in der <a href="https://www.xing.com/events/net-usergroup-17-10-2013-1307444">Gästeliste</a> ein.</p>  <p><strong>Sprecher     <br /></strong><strong>     <br /></strong><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; display: inline" align="left" src="http://www.postsharp.net/Design/images/Gael_Fraiteur.jpg" />Gael has been passionately programming since childhood. His vision - to build aspect-oriented software that would offer .NET developers the same productivity benefits as those enjoyed by the Java community - became a reality when, in 2004, he built and released PostSharp to the wild. PostSharp has steadily grown to become the most comprehensive aspect-oriented software for .NET available today.<strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>  <p>Design patterns are now universally accepted and significantly improved the way we design software. However, they had relatively little impact on how we implement it. Except rare exception like the ‘using’ or ‘lock’ keywords, most patterns must still be implemented by hand, resulting in large quantities of boilerplate code that must be validated by peer review. However, smarter compilers and development tools could do a better job by automatically implementing part of the pattern and automatically validating the other part that has been implemented manually. This talk advocates for a better integration of pattern thinking in the whole development cycle. It discusses how design pattern automation is possible today in .NET using PostSharp, FxCop, and Nemerle.</p>  <p><strong>Agenda</strong></p>  <p>-Patterns in architecture and methodology    <br />-The feedback loop: ex-post patterns and refactoring     <br />-Well-written patterns can be partially automated     <br />-Disposable Object: a pattern with framework/compiler support     <br />-Observable Object: a ready-made implementation with PostSharp     <br />-Validating pattern implementation using FxCop     <br />-Metaprogramming: dynamic languages, scala macros, Nemerle     <br />-Automating design pattern implementation/validation using PostSharp</p>
